## Hello! I'm Connie (she/her), a first-year Data Science major at UC Irvine.

I am interested in expanding my skill set by learning new languages and creating new projects. My work's purpose is to promote accessibility and sustainability in the environment. I'm interested in front and backend development and am open to opportunities to grow in both!

Feel free to connect with me through my [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/coyang/)!
